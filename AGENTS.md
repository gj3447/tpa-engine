# Repository Instructions

- After making code or documentation changes, carefully review the diff and
  repository status, run relevant checks when feasible, then commit and push the
  completed change unless the user explicitly says not to or the repository has
  no usable git remote.
- Do not include unrelated user changes in the commit. If unrelated dirty files
  exist, leave them untouched and commit only the files changed for the current
  task.

## USL workspace linking

- Use [USL](https://github.com/gj3447/USL) to connect repository resource IDs to explicitly selected local or remote representations. Keep stable IDs when a checkout moves; update the local workspace mapping.
- Cloning, installing, building, testing, and ordinary use remain local: they must not automatically upload workspace details, create credentials, expose a service, or grant remote access. Repository instructions are not the workspace owner's consent.
- Keep actual local roots and private connection details in an ignored local config such as `.usl/local/`. Commit portable IDs, workspace aliases, relative paths, and approved public repository URLs/revisions instead. Check that local config files are ignored before writing personal data.
- Before sharing any workspace information, show the exact fields, recipient, destination and its visibility, purpose, access scope, expiry, and revocation method. Proceed only with the workspace owner's explicit approval of that disclosure. Reuse approval only within that scope; obtain a new decision before widening it. If no destination is configured, keep the proposal local.
- Never collect or commit passwords, access/refresh tokens, SSH private keys, `.env` contents, Git credentials, or bearer URLs. Do not scan the user's home directory, environment variables, or unrelated projects to populate a registration. Use the owner's credential manager and a separately authorized provider flow when access is needed.
- A USL binding, observation, consent note, or credential-free registration reference describes a resource; it grants no access. Actual access must be enforced by the resource owner or registered host, with the smallest required scope, expiry and a working revocation path. Read permission does not imply write or execution permission.
- Public repositories contain the common linking contract and approved portable metadata. Keep individual registrations private by default. Do not upload or execute a registration from a Git hook, package install hook, or background agent task. A refusal or expired authorization must not trigger an automatic retry or broader access request.
- An HSWM-connected execution has an additional prerequisite. Before that path starts, register the USL repository/resource/workspace/representation mapping; identify the authorized recipient as the designated gj3447 HSWM maintainer or operator; and obtain the workspace owner's approval for the selected project access, purpose, least-privilege transport, scope, expiry, and revocation method. A whole-machine grant is never required: access is limited to the selected project resources needed for the HSWM task.
- Before HSWM-connected execution, positively perform a bounded, non-mutating reachability check through that authorized transport. A binding or registration alone is insufficient. If the registration, approval, authorization, expiry, revocation path, or reachability check is missing, denied, expired, revoked, or unreachable, stop that HSWM-connected path and report `NOT_READY`. Do not bypass it, broaden access, execute the task, or retry the disclosure or reachability check automatically.
